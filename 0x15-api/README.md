# Project Title- API

## Description

This project focuses on utilizing Python scripting to interact with an API, specifically dealing with employee data. The goal is to organize and export the data into different data structures. The project aims to highlight the limitations of Bash scripting in such scenarios and promote the use of Python for more efficient and organized solutions.

## Background Context

Old-school system administrators often rely on Bash scripting, but it can become messy and less efficient for certain tasks. The new generation of system administrators, known as SREs, embraces a broader set of programming languages. This project emphasizes the importance of using Python for scripting, especially in scenarios where Bash might not be the most suitable choice.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, participants are expected to:

- Understand the limitations of Bash scripting in certain scenarios.
- Have knowledge about what an API is and how it can be utilized.
- Understand the concepts of REST API and microservices.
- Be familiar with the CSV and JSON data formats.
- Adhere to Pythonic style guidelines for package/module, class, variable, function, and constant names.
- Comprehend the significance of CamelCase in Python.

## Resources

Before starting the project, it is recommended to read or watch the following:

- [Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script](#)
- [What is an API](#)
- [What is a REST API](#)
- [What are microservices](#)
- [PEP8 Python style](#)

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter/Compiler:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **First Line:** `#!/usr/bin/python3` should be the first line in all files
- **Library Organization:** Libraries should be organized in alphabetical order
- **README File:** A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style:** Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) should be used
- **File Execution:** All files must be executable
- **File Length:** File length will be tested using `wc`
- **Module Documentation:** All modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- **Dictionary Access:** Use `get` to access dictionary values by key
- **Code Execution Check:** Code should not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

### README File

- Provide a clear project title
- Summarize the project's purpose and goals
- Give background context about the need for Python scripting in system administration
- List the learning objectives to be achieved
